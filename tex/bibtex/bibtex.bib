  Abstract                 = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The observation of quantum oscillations in the electrical resistance of YBa$_{\textrm{2}}$Cu$_{\textrm{3}}$O$_{\textrm{6.5}}$, is reported, establishing the existence of a well-defined Fermi surface in the ground state of underdoped copper oxides (once superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic field). The low oscillation frequency reveals a Fermi surface made of small pockets, in contrast to the large cylinder characteristic of the overdoped regime.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  Abstract                 = {Upon application of an external tuning parameter, a magnetic state can be driven to a normal metal state at zero temperature. This phenomenon is known as quantum criticality and leads to fascinating responses in thermodynamics and transport of the compound. In the standard picture, a single quantum critical point occurs at zero temperature, which results in a nontrivial critical behaviour in its vicinity. Here we show that in two dimensions the scenario is considerably more complex due to the enormous amount of quantum fluctuations. Instead of the single point separating the antiferromagnet from the normal metal, we have discovered a broad region between these two phases where the magnetic order is destroyed but certain areas of the Fermi surface are closed by a large gap. This gap reflects the formation of a novel quantum state characterised by a superposition of d-wave superconductivity and a quadrupole-density wave, id est a state in which an electron quadrupole density spatially oscillates with a period drastically different from the one of the original spin-density wave. At moderate temperatures both orders co-exist at short distances but thermal fluctuations destroy the long-range order. Below a critical temperature the fluctuations are less essential and superconductivity becomes stable. This new phenomenon may shed some light on the origin of the mysterious pseudogap state and of the high-temperature transition into the superconducting state in cuprates. Our results demonstrate that quantum phase transitions between antiferromagnets and normal metals in layered materials may be the proper playground for search of new high temperature superconductors.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the leading challenges of condensed matter physics in the past few decades is an understanding of the high-temperature copper-oxide superconductors. Although the d-wave character of the superconducting state is well understood, the normal state in the underdoped regime has eluded understanding. Here, we review the past few years of quantum oscillation measurements performed in the underdoped cuprates that have culminated in an understanding of the normal ground state of these materials. A nodal electron pocket created by charge order is found to characterize the normal ground state in YBa2Cu3O6+δ and is likely universal to a majority of the cuprate superconductors. An open question remains regarding the origin of the suppression of the antinodal density of states at the Fermi energy in the underdoped normal state, either from mainly charge correlations or, more likely, from mainly pairing and/or magnetic correlations that precede charge order.},
